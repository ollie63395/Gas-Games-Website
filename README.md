# Gas Games Website

- A customised online website that I created for one of the local Board Game shop called **"Gas Games"** here in Melbourne, Australia!

- This project helped me practice my knowledge in **web developement** using JavaScript, jQuery, HTML/CSS, and Google DevTools ;-)

- Important features:
  -   **Target Audience:** family members, students and young adults, and strategy gamers.
  -   **Design Style:** follow the Principles of Visual Design in User Experience
  -   **Accessibility:** Perceivable Principle 1.4.6 - Contrast Level AAA - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

- I also sharpened my basic understanding of client-side scripting by researching and implementing the Summernote interactive feature using JavaScript code, which allows user to create and send query to the shop's website using a variety of text editing features
